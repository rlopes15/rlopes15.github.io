<p>Over the course of October and November of 2022, I had the opportunity to produce, direct and edit a documentary about the Deaf Education and American Sign Language Club and the deaf experience at Fordham University. I interviewed two students at Fordham University at Lincoln Center, both were a part of the club. The first interview was with Mary Olivette Bookman, the clubâ€™s President, and she helped understand the operation of the club and their goals. The other interview was with Mykaylah Moran, a deaf student, who shared her personal experiences regarding Fordham and her situation. This was not my first experience with media production in these capacities, but it was my first one having proper equipment and time. I tried to tell a story about the deaf experience at Fordham under the medium of documentaries. Despite my distaste for this cut and unending desire to edit it again, I feel this work is representative of how much I have learned since the start of the semester when I had no camera or editing experience. Hope you enjoy it!</p>
