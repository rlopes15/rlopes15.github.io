        <img src="Images\bio.jpg" alt="It's a me.">

        <p>I was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil around 21 years ago. In that short span of time, I have managed to attend a couple of different schools and engage with different cultures. I am currently attempting to become something in media production, but I don't really know what I am doing. This website may seem like a collection of random work. This is not by design. It is VERY RANDOM. Personally, I feel it reflects the utter chaos that my mind is. Anyway, I am a student at Fordham University at Lincoln Center set to graduate May 2024. Double majoring as Communications and, Digital tech and Emerging media , I am currently focused on getting a job as an assitant editor (or whatever I can get). Have fun looking around! </p>
